# AMM with Stable Curves

## Project Description

This project implements an Automated Market Maker (AMM) with stable curve pricing mechanics and built-in transaction rate limiting per address. The contract enables efficient trading between two tokens using a stable curve formula that reduces slippage for similar-valued assets, while preventing spam and manipulation through sophisticated rate limiting mechanisms.

The AMM features two core functions:
- **stable-swap**: Executes token swaps using stable curve mathematics with rate limiting protection
- **add-liquidity**: Allows users to provide liquidity to the pool while respecting transaction limits

Each user is limited to a maximum number of transactions within a specified time window, ensuring fair access and preventing abuse of the system.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a robust, fair, and efficient decentralized exchange infrastructure that:

- **Promotes Fair Trading**: Implements rate limiting to prevent front-running, spam attacks, and market manipulation
- **Optimizes for Stable Assets**: Uses stable curve mathematics to minimize slippage for assets with similar values
- **Ensures Security**: Built-in protection mechanisms guard against common DeFi vulnerabilities
- **Democratizes Access**: Provides equal trading opportunities for all users regardless of their transaction frequency
- **Maintains Liquidity**: Efficient liquidity provision mechanisms ensure deep markets and competitive pricing

The project aims to be a cornerstone of decentralized finance, providing a secure and reliable platform for token swaps while maintaining the principles of decentralization and user sovereignty.

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Rate Limiting
- **Dynamic Rate Limits**: Implement adaptive rate limiting based on user reputation and staking
- **Premium Tiers**: Allow users to stake tokens for higher transaction limits
- **Whitelist Functionality**: Enable verified market makers to have elevated limits

### Phase 2: Advanced AMM Features
- **Multi-Asset Pools**: Expand beyond two-token pools to support complex asset baskets
- **Yield Farming**: Integrate liquidity mining rewards for pool participants  
- **Governance Token**: Launch native governance token for protocol parameters
- **Flash Loans**: Implement flash loan functionality for advanced trading strategies

### Phase 3: Cross-Chain Integration
- **Bridge Compatibility**: Integrate with cross-chain bridges for multi-network liquidity
- **Layer 2 Scaling**: Deploy on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions for faster, cheaper transactions
- **Interoperability**: Connect with other DeFi protocols for composable yield strategies

### Phase 4: Institutional Features
- **API Integration**: Professional trading APIs for institutional market makers
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics and reporting tools
- **Compliance Tools**: KYC/AML integration for regulated environments
- **Insurance Protocol**: Integrated insurance coverage for liquidity providers

### Phase 5: Advanced Market Making
